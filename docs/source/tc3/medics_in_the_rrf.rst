The Structure of the Medical Teams
===================================

In the 1st RRF our medical teams all fall under a unified chain of command called the medical corps.

The medical corps consists of 25 personnel split into 12 teams of 2 with a single officer in their chain of command. Each medical team is responsible for their own readiness and training with one of the team members being designated as senior medic. This senior medic represents the point of contact and leader of the group - whom must have qualified the Joint Service Radio School so that they are able to operate comfortably at a platoon level. The Senior Medic role does not denote additional medical or tactical training and is more used to define a point of contact and chain of command for the element.

There two man medical teams will then be attached to other elements in the group on a per deployment basis. Each team must be qualified to deploy with the team to which they are attached meaning that medical teams may have to attend qualifications such as Air Assault or Armoured Operations.

Within the operational environment medical teams are expected to be self sustaining in their operation whilst reporting directly to the Officer in Charge of the element they are attached to. This means that medical teams are afforded a relatively high level of autonomy in their operation and equipment.

Possible Attachment Elements
-----------------------------

Within the RRF there are a large number of different types of elements to which a medical team could be attached. Below is a list of each type of element alongside the role played by the medics and the advised methods of execution.

Prior to any deployment the medical team will spend two weeks training with the element they will be attached to in order to gain operational confidence.

**Light Infantry**

In Light Infantry platoons the medical team is expected to operate their own vehicle - usually an ambulance type vehicle or a unarmed truck - which should operate in the center of any convoys.

When dismounted medical teams will carry all necessary medical equipment for them to operate a CCP and will remain set back from the front lines at a location designated by the Platoon Leader of the element. At all times medical teams will avoid being involved in combat.

Typically an infantry squad will be tasked to provide security to the medical team however at times they will need to operate their own security.

**Mechanized Infantry**

In Mechanized Infantry platoons the medical team is expected to operate their own vehicle - usually a Stryker medical vehicle ( once again unarmed and marked with appropriate medical markings ) - and maintain a position in the center of any convoy.

The team will almost always remain close to their vehicles as they act as their own drivers. Mechanized vehicles are not normally left unattended and as such the medical team should remain with the vehicle convoy and provide a CCP at that location.

**Air Assault and Airborne Infantry**

Medics attached to Air Assault and Airborne infantry platoons will operate with the platoons to provide an embedded medical capability on the ground and a centralized hand over to further medical care. They are not in possesion of any special vehicles and as such will be unable to stitch wounds or provide blood transfusions.

**MEDEVAC Helicopter Flight**

MEDEVAC helicopter personnel are trained to operate specially equipped blackhawk helicopters to carry casualties back to base for Level 2 care. Medical teams assigned to a MEDEVAC helicopter will work with the flight crew to receive casualties in the battlezone and bring them back to a Level 2 facility.
