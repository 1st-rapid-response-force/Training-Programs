The Board of Operations
==========================================

Structure of the Board of Operations 
-------------------------------------------

    a. Any BoO member who is removed from Active Roster by way of extended leave or discharge must step down from the BoO.
    b. Active Duty positions must be material in purpose and have a direct role in the operation of the group. 

Decisions of the Board of Operations
-------------------------------------------
1.	The BoO is free to make any assertion it wishes regarding the unit and it’s operations provided it can obtain a majority vote of it’s members on the issue.
