Introduction
---------------

AIT 11 is designed to provide members who have just graduated BCT with a solid base knowledge with which to progress in our infantry elements. It serves as the primary introduction to our tactical mecahnisms and our SOPs as well as providing members with an understanding of how further training will proceed.

AIT is also a chance for the recruit to get a glimpse of some of the more complicated roles in the unit such as leadership roles ( "that is covered at a leadership level" ) and specialists ( "T3C leads into a full medical corps").

.. warning::

  If at any point a recruit reveals they have not read the documentation fully they should be removed from the session and told to apply for the next available time slot.

.. _forming_up:

Stage 1 - Forming Up
------------------------------------------------

Instructors should form recruits up in front of the 23rd Division Memorial near the barracks area. Instructors should bring a truck to this location so they can carry recruits.

Students should be greeted curteously and provided with equipment necessary for the training. Once all students have arrived instructors should load recruits into the vehicles and proceed to Live Fire area north of the Barracks.

Example:
  “Welcome to AIT Phase I.  This is the first of two phases of training where you will learn the fundamentals of movement formations as part of a fire team, movement techniques, and introductory battle drills for reacting to contact, assaulting an enemy position, and breaking contact.  Upon completion of this phase of AIT, you will understand basic concepts that will allow you to operate effectively as a member of a dismounted fire team.”

  “Understand this before we start; we are aware that there are multiple methods for conducting various movements and battle drills.  This training will familiarize you with the foundations of how our unit conducts these actions.  There is a time and place to debate tactics and techniques and this is not it.  At this time, are there any questions?"

  “You will need the following equipment to conduct this phase of AIT.  No other equipment is necessary or authorized for this course. Also, until the live fire exercise, there is no reason for your weapon to be loaded.  Ensure that magazines are removed from your primary and secondary weapon before we move to the training area.

  “Ok, at this time board the vehicle and we will move to the AIT Phase I training area”

.. _safety:

Stage 2 - Safety Briefing
-------------------------

Instructors should cleary explain the following points to recruits:
  * All weapons will be clear and on safety unless explicitly instructed to load them by an instructor.

  * All live fire excercises will be done with a full awareness of the muzzle and trigger discipline will be maintained at all times.

  * This training segment does not require explosive of any kind.

  * Smoke grenades are the only acceptable pyrotechnic device for this training.

  * If any injuries occur all training will stop and all weapons will be made safe. A medical team will be called ASAP.

At this time trainees should move to the formations area.

.. _formations:

Stage 3 - Fire Team Formations
------------------------------

Instructors should ensure recruits have a good view of each fire team formation on display.

Each formation should be explained clearly and the tradeoff between security and speed should be discussed and assessed in each case.

Finally the instructors should get the recruit class to form up in the formations to demonstrate their layout.

Example:

  “Ok trainees, we will now discuss the fundamentals of movement stances and element movement techniques.  When we are complete, you will be able to move in various stances, understand the benefits of those stances, and have a basic understanding of movement techniques as part of a fire team.”

  “There are five basic movement stance mechanics that you can use while conducting a movement.  The first is walking pace.  In this stance, you will move at a normal walking pace with your weapon lowered or holstered. Watch this demonstration.”

  “Second is combat stance, weapon ready.  In this stance, you will move at a slight jog with your weapon raised.  This is a good stance for moving when engagement with a threat is expected as it will allow you to react quickly to acquire targets. Watch this demonstration.”

  “Third is combat stance, weapon lowered.  In this stance, you will move at a slight jog with your weapon at the low ready, or low carry.  This is the standard movement stance. Watch this demonstration.”

  “The fourth is jogging with weapon holstered.  In this stance, you will move at a jog with your weapon holstered or slung on your back.  This stance allows for faster movement, but limits reaction time to contact. Watch this demonstration.”

  "The final stance is sprinting.  In this stance, you will move quickly at a sprint for a short duration of time.  This is a good stance for covering ground quickly, such as when crossing a road, or moving between cover. Watch this demonstration.”

  “Bear in mind your movement will be limited based on your equipment load and effects on stamina.  You will not be able to sprint if your stamina is low, and you will move slower in all stances when your stamina is depleted.”

.. _bounding:

Stage 4 - Fire Team Bounding
----------------------------

Instructors will provide trainees with instruction on the types of bounding technique - alternating and succesive. Instructors should explain to the trainees what the purpose of each technique is and how to enact them.

Example:

  “Ok trainees, now we will discuss bounding as a member of a fire team.  If you remember from basic training, bounding is used to close with the enemy while maintaining constant fires and movement between cover.  The principles are no different for a fire team, with one exception; the fire team is larger than a buddy team.”

  “There are two standard bounding techniques used in a fire team; alternating, and successive bounding.  Imagine that the fire team is on line and the positions are numbered from one to four.  In alternating bounding, #1 and #2 will move to a position to the front and re-establish engagement with the enemy.  Once set, #3 and #4 will move to a position past the other element and re-establish contact.  This will continue until the team leader ceases movement.  In successive bounding, #1 and #2 will move to a position to the front and re-establish contact with the enemy.  Once set, #3 and #4 will move to a position on line with the other element (not past as in alternating), and re-establish contact.  This will continue until the team leader ceases movement.”

.. _dangerareas:

Stage 5 - Crossing LinearDanger Areas
--------------------------------------

**WIP**

Stage 9 - Radio Communications Training
----------------------------------------

Instructors should ensure recruits have a 152 type radio on their person.

Instructors will then walk recruits through how to:
  * Change Channel
  * Set an alternate channel
  * Change Volume
  * Change Stereo settings to create multi ear effects
  * Broadcast on the radio.

Once the recruits have got their radios setup instructors should explain the you this is me format and walk recruits through performing a radio check. Instructors should also ask recruits to tell them how to respond to bad radio checks.

Once a radio check has been performed trainees should be walked through ACE and contact reports over the radio.

Finally - instructors should walk through PACE contigency plans and how to deal with signal disruption. It is often useful to explain how to react in the event of radio's being jammed and scenarios that may cause that such an EOD team deploying a THOR jammer during IED disposal.

Stage 10 - Tactical Combat Casualty Care
-----------------------------------------

Instructors should meet recruits at the MOUT training facility.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care is taught verbally and without demonstration at the AIT level - however it should still be covered.

Start by talking through how to react to an injury. Routine pitfalls of this process include ensuring trainees understand not to render medical aid under fire and that once they begin rendering aid it should focus on bleeding control.

You should also explain that medics will not render frontline aid and that the casualty will need to be taken to the CCP for frontline medical aid.

You should also walk trainees through the concept of a battle buddy to ensure that if you are left unconcious from a wound someone is aware.

Finally walk them through applying a tourniquet with ACE and explain the handoff procedures to medical personnel ( detailed below for ease of reading ):

  * Go to the Triage area of the CCP
  * Give the medical personnel the roster number ( name ), element and cause of injury of the casualty.

You should run recruits through this as a role play excercise to ensure they are properly able to react to one of the team taking fire.

.. warning::
  DO NOT DISCHARGE ROUND WHILST TRAINING T3C.

Stage 11 - MOUT
----------------

.. danger::
  Ensure at the start of the MOUT section that no recruit is in possesion of a live grenade and that they are exclusively holding practise grenades (blue grenades) and stun grenades.

MOUT is a long section of the AIT and should be taught in the following format. For brevity this section will not detail the exact tactics used in MOUT and you should instead refer to the training material itself for SOP on execution of a given tactic.

Start by forming recruits up at the Bleacher of the glasshouse. You should begin by explaining what MOUT is and why it poses a unique set of challenges to an infantry element.

Start by talking them through approaching a structure and the stack formation. You should then take the trainees over to the room with a central breach on the far side of the glasshouse from the bleachers.

Walk trainees through the fatal funnel and how to perform a normal breach - one without an accelerated or explosive breach.

Ensure they are able to correctly stack - set - then move onto a point of domination. Repeat this until every member of the team can correctly execute.

Once the team has succesfully completed this excercise run the same excercise on the same room but with a practise grenade breach.

.. danger::
  Ensure only practise grenades are used for MOUT.

Next move onto the room with a corner breach and ensure they are able to breach it correctly and move to their points of domination.

At this stage take them into the corridors and explain the rolling T. Instructors will have them move around the glasshouse until they are satisfied with their performance. Instructors should ensure that this movement includes movement around corners, T-intersections and four way intersections.

Once this is complete instructors should walk trainees through how to breach and secure the two central rooms of the glasshouse that present interior room and short room scenarios.

At this stage trainees should enter the glass house and proceed to the Killhouse.

.. danger::
  Before entering the safehouse provide a full safety briefing around the use of controlled fire and check again that no one is carrying live explosives.

  Trainees should clear and safety their weapons before exiting the killhouse walls and should not load their weapons until they are inside the killhouse walls.

Once inside the killhouse instructors should move around inside the rooms and on the gangways to maintain good visability of the trainees.

Instructors should make corrections to poor technique on the fly as necessary.

Continue moving around the killhouse until all questions are addressed and the instructors are satisfied with the techniques of the recruits.

.. note::
  Whilst moving through the killhouse instructors should ensure that trainees are tested on a variety of breaches including using flash greandes and practise grenades.

  It is also a good idea to simulate some weapon failure - perhaps by getting one trainee to remove their magazine and simulate their weapon failing on entry.
