Weapon Qualifications and Testing
==================================

In the RRF, weapon qualification takes place on a range designed for the weapon. Qualification runs involve hitting a certain number of targets, sometimes with a particular accuracy, within a given window of time.

Upon completing a qualification, which must take place in the presence of an officer, the weapon you qualified on will be unlocked in the web Loadout editor so you can use it in the deployment environments.

During basic training you will complete qualifications on the P226 pistol, the SCAR-L Assault Rifle and the M67 hand grenade.

This will qualify you to use the basic equipment required for any role in the unit.

.. note::

  Upon completing any qualification attempt, you should remove the magazine from the weapon, attempt to fire once down range to ensure the barrel is empty, then shout "Weapon Safe Drill Sergeant" to communicate that your weapon is clear.

.. warning::
  You are only permitted to shoot twice on each range during a BCT session - failure to qualify on the ranges will result in failing the training session and being required to retake it.

========================
Rifle Qualification
========================

For the rifle qualification range, you will discharge 60 rounds, one round per target, from a variety of stances.

The weapon used will be a SCAR-L with iron sights and no enhancements or addons. Targets will appear at ranges between 25 and 300 metres and should be acquired, id'd and engaged within 5 seconds.

If you miss a target, you should not attempt to discharge a second round onto the target. Attempting to do so will lead to disqualification.

Your score will be judged on the following thresholds.

45 / 60 - Qualified

50 / 60 - Marksman

58 / 60 - Expert Marksman

During basic training you will be allowed to shoot the range twice and the higher of your two scores will be recorded.

========================
Pistol Qualification
========================

You will use the P226 Navy Variant to engage 30 targets with one round per target. You will be required to reload your weapon during this qualification excercise.

Your score will be judged on the following thresholds.

20 / 30 - Qualified

25 / 30 - Marksman Pistoleer

30 / 30 - Expert Pistoleer

===========================
Hand Grenade Qualification
===========================

You will throw 5 grenades on the grenade range. You will be judged on two criteria:

1. Safety of use
2. Accuracy

To qualify you must hit targets with three of the grenades without any safety violations.

When throwing a grenade,  safety and communication are key. You should observe the situation around you and ensure that all friendly personnel are out of range from the blast. You should then clearly yell Frag Out, as well as the intended target. For example "FRAG OUT, BUNKER 12 O'CLOCK". Only after this announcement is made should you begin to throw the grenade.

When handling grenades, you should always try to keep a non lethal grenade selected in your equipment unless you are ready to throw the lethal grenade. This prevents accidental grenade discharges.

.. danger::
  Any serious safety violations on the BCT grenade range will lead to immediate course failure and will require the recruit to retake the entire training program.
