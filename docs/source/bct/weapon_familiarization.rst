Weapon Familiarization
=====================================

The RRF uses a diverse array of weapons equipment in order to accomplish its objective. It is important that you are able to identify and safely handle these weapons so that you may effectively communicate and work with other members of the group.

===============================
The Importance of Weapon Safety
===============================

The safe handling of weapons is incredibly important in the RRF because of the depth of our simulation. Friendly Fire incidents are treated the same as legitimate casualties and will cause the same level of tactical problems.

Friendly Fire will always result in disciplinary action automatically and in all cases. This may result in negative action up to and including a dishonourable discharge.

All weapons in the RRF environment are fitted with Safety switches. These are activated by pressing Shift + ( the button directly left of the 1 key - varies by national keyboard ). You can check your control settings if you struggle to find the key. This safety catch will prevent accidental discharges and other problematic events.

==========================
The Rules of Weapon Safety
==========================

1. Do not point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill. The weapon should remain in the rest position when not in use.

2. In safe areas where security is maintained, magazines should be removed from the weapon system and on supporting weapons the safety engaged.

3. Do not discharge your weapon for any reason other than combat engagement ( Celebration Shots and Direction Indicating Shots waste ammo and risk lives )

==========================
Ammunition and Equipment
==========================

The RRF uses a system unlike any other unit for the issue of ammunition and equipment.

Ammunition and Equipment are both kept stored in a locked ammunition cage near to the armourer on base. Only members of the logistics elements are able to access the cage and access is remotely controlled from the TOC by the Officer on Duty at the base in question.

We treat ammunition and equipment levels extremely seriously in our group and a lot of our gameplay revolves around logistics, resupply and conservation. This is all balanced by both the weight and stamina systems and our persistence systems.

Our standard issue is 9 magazines to an individual which will be issued by the quartermaster in squad level boxes.

==========================
Weapon Familiarization
==========================

The RRF uses a wide selection of weapons for different roles. Each weapon has qualification requirements, which can be viewed in the online armoury. You can unlock more weapons for your use by completing training programs and qualification courses.

You should always coordinate with your element leader to ensure you have a weapon system that benefits the team. You can select your weapon, attachments and other equipment using the Web Loadout editor, which can then be picked up from the armourer at any RRF in-game base.
