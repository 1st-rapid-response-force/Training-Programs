Pre-Jump Sequence
===================

The Pre Jump Sequence is the hardest part of the Airborne training program and represents the most complex and important part of the jump both technically and from a simulation standpoint.

.. warning::

  Incorrect application of these techniques can cause death to yourself or others as well as possible damage to the aircraft.

  Pay attention to instructions given by the Jump Master and Aircraft crew at all times.

Five Minutes Out
----------------

When the aircraft is 5 minutes out from the DZ, the jump master will stand up and move to his position at the rear of the aircraft.

The Jump Master will call out “5 minutes” and all jumpers will respond back to him with a shout of “5 minutes”.

At this time the Jump Master will open the doors and instruct the jumpers to stand up by side. Pay attention to the side called and do not stand up until your side is called to prevent over crowding in the jump area.

.. note::

  To stand up you should use the scroll wheel option "Move Inside".

  **DO NOT USE THE VANILLA EJECT OR GET OUT BUTTON**

**Equipment Checks**

Once you have stood up you should line up in a file on your assigned side without proceeding past the danger area of the door denoted by a red line. Any area beyond the red line is considered unsafe and you may fall out of the aircraft past this point.

Once lined up and facing the front of the aircraft - i.e away from the jump exit - the Jump Master will call "Check Equipment".

Starting at the rear you should check the equipment of the jumper behind you in the stack before turning around and allowing the next jumper to inspect your gear.

.. note::

  When checking for equpment you are looking for the following things:

  * Does the Jumper have a parachute?
  * Is the parachute attached to the rear of the jumper and not the front?
  * Does the Jumper have Goggles on?
  * Does the Jumper have a helmet on?

Once this process is complete, all jumpers will be aligned in files on either side facing toward the exit doors at the rear of the aircraft. The last man in the file - i.e the one closest the door - should call to the Jump Master that their side is set.

**The equipment check process should take no more than 3 minutes form standing up to being jump ready for a full insertion of 25 people**

Approaching the DZ
--------------------

After the equipment checks, the jump master will coordinate with the crew for an eta to the drop zone. The Jump Master will relay this information to the jumpers and all jumpers should repeat back the information to the Jump Master.

When the aircraft is one minute out, the jump master will tell the first jumpers to “stand in the door”. They will move one step beyond the red line, turn and face the door. Jumpers should take care not to move into the door itself to prevent a premature exit.

All other jumpers will move forward and close up the space so that the next jumper is on line with the red danger indicator.
