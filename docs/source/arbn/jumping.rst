Conducting the Jump
====================

The jump master will continue to give warnings at the 30 second and 10 second marks. You should remain focused on the door so that you do not delay the jump by missing a key or getting your alignment wrong.

The Green Light
------------------

.. note::
    Aircraft in the 1st rrf are not equipped with a physical green light. This call will be done over radio and relayed by the Loadmaster as opposed to being an actual light.

When the aircraft crew indicates green light, the jump master will announce “Green light go, go, go” to the first jumper and they will exit the aircraft.

Jumpers will continue to move forward to the door and exit as the jump master says “go” to them.

It is critical to the timing of the jump to continue moving toward the door and exiting when the jump master says to go. If you exit early, you risk injuring yourself and if you exit late you risk missing the drop zone, or causing others to miss the drop zone.

.. danger::
    Remember to only exit the Aircraft once you are told to do so by the jump master.

Again this is not a freefall course. You are expected to open your parachute 1-3 seconds after exiting the airframe. This also helps to prevents jumpers from colliding in the air and injuring themselves.

Once you hear “go”, walk forward and you will ejected from the aircraft.

Count to 3, then use the scroll wheel to open your parachute. You will then be able to steer yourself so you do not miss the drop zone. You will not have much time with which to navigate the parachute so you should only make minor course adjustments to avoid any obstructions such as trees or fences that may be in the DZ.

As you approach the ground, make sure to “flare” your parachute by pressing the backward movement key, or you may get injured during the landing.

.. warning::

    You should refrain from making liberal use of the forward movement key. Doing so will increase your airspeed and risks causing severe injury on impact.

.. note::

    Upon landing you may sometimes become entangled on buildings or trees. If this happens, use your ACE self interaction key to cut your parachute away allowing you to fall to the ground.

    This will incur some damage but will ultimately prevent you from dying or being stuck in a tree.
