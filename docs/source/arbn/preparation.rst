Preparation for an Airborne Jump
=================================

Preparation for an Airborne Jump consists of forming up, verifying equipment and loading the aircraft.

Briefing
--------------

Before you prepare your equipment, your jump master will gather your element and brief on the planned LZ, altitudes, wind speeds and other factors affecting your jump.

He will also point out any hazards you may face on the way down.

Preparing your Equipment
--------------------------

Once you have been briefed on the DZ you will move to the Preparation Area.

The Logistics personnel working on the jump will have setout a rigging station for you to use.

To use this, you must first use your ACE interaction menu to place your backpack on your front. This can be found under Equipment > Put Backpack on Front. This allows you to equip a parachute without sacrificing your backpack - which is essential in order to remain combat effective once on the ground.

Once you have transitioned your backpack - approach the rigging station and equip one steerable parachute. Once again we use steerable parachutes to allow for some control during decent but you will simulate a static line opening by waiting 1-3 seconds after exiting the aircraft to deploy the parachute.

Moving to Staging Positions
-----------------------------

At this time you should form into two ranks - normally one rank per squad with the jump master at the front. Which rank you are in will dictate which side of the aircraft you board from and the Aircraft logistics specialist on the ground will direct you to board the airframe safely.

.. note::

  During this staging time you will be assigned a Jump Number.

  A Jump Number represents which order you will exit the aircraft in and will be used to identify you during the flight.

  Make sure that you are clear on your number and remember it for the duration of the jump. Write it down if needs be.

When you have all your equipment and are assigned to a jump position, the jump master will assume control of the formation, and upon instruction from the ground crew, move you to the rear of the aircraft for boarding.
