Weapons and Marksmanship
=========================

This manual covers the issue, safe employment and tactical techniques associated with infantry weapon employment. This manual does not cover specilaity weapon systems such as Automatic Rifles, Grenade Launchers or DMRs.

Weapon Safety
--------------

All weapons in the 1st RRF come with a safety mechanism which should be engaged when outside of a combat area or live fire range. By default the safety is toggled by pressing ```Ctrl + ~``` and will prevent the weapon from firing.

Friendly fire instances are treated extremely seriously under the disciplinary policy so it is important that members maintain the rules of weapon safety when operating in the battlespace.

The Rules of Weapon Handling
------------------------------

1. Do not point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill. The weapon should remain in the rest position when not in use.

2. In safe areas where security is maintained, magazines should be removed from the weapon system or on supporting weapons the safety engaged.

3. Do not discharge your weapon for any reason other than combat engagement ( Celebration Shots and Direction Indicating Shots risk lives and waste ammunition )

Issued Weapons
-----------------

In the RRF infantry are permitted to modify their rifle to their liking including the visual appearance and spray colour, the type of optic and additional furniture. All infantry must carry at least a AN/PEQ15 laser module but may opt to also carry a flashlight in addition to their PEQ15.

Weapon Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current standard issue weapon systems of the 1RRF infantry are the M4, M4A1 and the M16A4 family of weapons.

Depending on the mission requirements command may issue special instructions to issue M4 Block II weapon systems however they are not standard issue and will not typically be available.

Optics
~~~~~~~

The currently approved weapon optics are:

* The ELCAN Specter
* The Eotech 552 with or without 3x magnifier
* The Aimpoint T2 with or without 3x magnifier
* The Trijicon Acog sight
* The Vortex Spitfire

.. warning:: The 1st RRF does not permit the use of thermal weapon optics for infantry men. 

Ammunition Management
----------------------

Standard ammunition issue for a RRF infantryman is 1 magazine in the weapon, 6 in the vest and 3 in the rucksack.

Partial magazines should be retained and can be repacked using the ACE interaction menu when there is a lull in combat that provides sufficient time and security to do so.

All issued infantry weapon system are magazine cross compatible with the exception of the 7.62 DMR which uses it's own magazines. As such FTLs will attempt to balance ammunition between different members of the fire team to maintain a uniform quantity of ammo within the team.

.. danger:: RRF infantry should not pickup enemy weapons. In the event that an element is rendered entirely black on ammunition command has the option to modify the ROE to allow the use of enemy weapons.

Types of Fire
--------------

Type of Fire are the different paces and accuracy of fire that can be employed.

Point Fire
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most basic and inuitive type of fire. It involves accurately aiming at and hitting the target - with each shot being aimed and placed. 

Point fire is typically used when the enemy is exposed and can be acquired and engaged precisely. Examples would be ambushing an enemy squad in the open or engaging a particular target inside a designated building.

Area Fire
~~~~~~~~~~

Area fire is used to engage a specific area instead of a specific target. This can be used to engage enemy units that are obscured, massed or beyond the effective range of the element's point fire capability.

During Area fire the shooters will identify areas that they know or suspect the enemy will be and focus on providing concentrated volumes of fire as opposed to well placed accuracy. The underlying theory is that the more rounds that are delivered downrange the higher the chance of hitting the enemy or effectively suppressing them.

Area fire involves firing at a higher rate than point fire but at a significantly lower rate than suppressing fire.

Suppresing Fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppressing fire involves placing a large volume of rounds on the enemy position so that they are unable to return effective fire. 

In order for suppression to be effective against an enemy the enemy must believe they are in danger of being hit by the suppresive fire. This means that although the pace of fire is fast the fire must remain within a close vicinity to the enemy position so as to keep them pinned.

Suppresive fire makes heavy use of ammunition and will normally be drawn down to area or point fire to conserve ammunition once fire supperiority has been established.

Weapon Malfunctions
--------------------

During use weapons will become hot which increases the possiblity of a weapon jam occuring.

To clear a weapon jam open the ACE interaction menu and select "Clear Jam" under the Equipment options.
