Weapon and Equipment List
===========================

The intent of our equipment and weapons loadout is to allow flexibility for member choices while maintaining a realistic standardization.  The following guidance provides detail on the approved infantry loadouts.  Any variation not included in this guidance is unauthorized unless cleared by the chain of command, who reserve the right to add to and remove from the loadouts on a mission specific basis. 

..danger: Any member with unauthorized weapons or equipment during an official event will be subject to disciplinary action.

All primary weapons must attach at least an IR laser device, but may also carry a PEQ15/Flashlight combo if desired.  If an under barrel option is available (i.e. grip pods for most rifles) and part of a US weapon pack ( e.g not russian ), then it is authorized.
