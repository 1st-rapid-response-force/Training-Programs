Message Protocols
=================

There are many formats for messages - the standards for which are laid out on this page. This page starts with the more basic information - such as the NATO phonetic alphabet - and eventually develops into more complex multi transmission messages.

Tactical Reports and Requests will be covered in the next chapters.

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet
---------------------------

The NATO Phoentic Alphabet is used when an alphanumeric character needs to be expressed over the network.

Basic Messages
--------------

A Basic Message is used when there is no official SOP for the communication or it is out of routine scope.

- *"RX, this is TX, MESSAGE, OVER"*
- *"TX, this is RX, SEND TRAFFIC, OVER"*
- *"RX, this is TX, MESSAGE blah blah blah, OVER"*
- *"TX, this is RX, ROGER OVER"*

Net Calls
---------

A Netcall is used by a leader - in this example Archer 6 - to establish that his elements are on the network.

- *“All stations this net, this is Archer 6, respond in sequence, radio check, OVER”*
- *"This is Archer 1-1, OVER”*
- *“This is Archer 1-2, OVER”*
- *“This is Archer 1-3, OVER”*
- *“All stations this net, this is Archer 6, ROGER, OUT”*

Radio Check
-----------

A Radio Check is used to conduct a check of communication between one or more indicated stations on the net

-	“(RX), this is (TX), radio check on FREQUENCY, OVER”
-	“(TX), this is (RX), ROGER on FREQUENCY, OVER”
-	“(RX), this is (TX), ROGER, OUT”
